ðŸ“„ Description: SCD1 Pipeline â€“ Uploading Customer Data to S3
This script is used as part of the SCD1 (Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1) testing workflow. It automates the process of uploading customer dataset files (customer_full_data.csv and customer_change_data.csv) from your Anaconda environment to an AWS S3 bucket. The uploaded data is then automatically processed by a Snowflake pipeline to reflect updates or inserts into a CUSTOMER table.

ðŸ”§ Pre-requisites:
AWS IAM credentials with access to S3

Anaconda environment with boto3 and yaml installed

Two CSV files: customer_full_data.csv and customer_change_data.csv

Snowflake data pipeline configured to ingest from the S3 location
