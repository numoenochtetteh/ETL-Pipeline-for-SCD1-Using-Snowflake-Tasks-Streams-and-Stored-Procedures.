ðŸ“œ DESCRIPTION: Snowflake Task Setup
In this step, we will create a Snowflake Task that automatically runs a Stored Procedure every 1 minute. This stored procedure will execute Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1 (SCD1) logic on the CUSTOMER table.

âœ… What Weâ€™re Doing:
Create a target table (CUSTOMER) to store the transformed data.

Write a stored procedure that:

Reads from the CUSTOMER_STREAM.

Loads the data into a temporary work table.

Performs a MERGE to update or insert rows into the target.

Set up a Snowflake Task to run this procedure every minute only if the stream has data.

Activate the task.

This automation is key in a data pipeline â€” it ensures your dimension table is updated in near real-time whenever new records land in the source.
