The AWS S3 and Snowflake integration is a crucial setup that allows data engineers and analysts to securely and efficiently load data from Amazon S3 into Snowflake for transformation, analysis, and reporting.

In this setup:

Amazon S3 serves as the cloud storage layer where raw data files (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet) are stored.

Snowflake acts as the cloud data warehouse that ingests and processes the data using scalable compute resources.

The integration involves:

✅ Creating an IAM Role in AWS with the appropriate permissions (like AmazonS3FullAccess).
✅ Enabling trust between AWS and Snowflake using Storage Integrations.
✅ Creating a Storage Integration object in Snowflake using your AWS Role ARN and S3 bucket location.
✅ Granting Snowflake access to the S3 bucket by updating trust policies with STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN and STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID.
✅ Creating a Snowflake Stage pointing to the S3 bucket, allowing Snowflake to query or copy files directly from S3.

This integration ensures:

Secure access without storing credentials.

Seamless and automated data loading pipelines.

Scalable architecture for real-time or batch ETL processes.
